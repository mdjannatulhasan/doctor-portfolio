                <p>My goal is to learn MERN stack. Currently I am working as a frontend developer. I want to see myself as a fullstack developer within next 2 years. To reach my goal, I am learning React for now. Next plan is to learn Nodejs and MongoDb. Hopefully I will reach my goal in next 2 years</p>
